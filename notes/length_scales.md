Different size are involved:
    - Pixel
    - Camera resolution and noise
    - Sample displacement between each image
    - Pattern (speckle) to track
    - Cross-correlation window size (computed using FFT)
    - "subpixel" registration



Different size are involved:


- Camera resolution & Camera noise: < pixel
- Pixel: # 6µm
- Sample displacement between each image: fraction of pixel up to 100 pixels
- Pattern (speckle) to track: few pixels to 100-200px

- Non-uniformity in strain field: ? hopefully not discontinious 
- variation in illumination... (low frequency noise)
